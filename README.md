# PHP Discord Webhook Messenger

This library is designed to be used to send messages to a
Discord Webhook URL to allow easy posting in Discord from PHP.

## Requirements

None of these should be too onerous and should be available from
most, if not all default distributions.

Below is a list of questions which you may or may not
already have thought.


### Why not PHP 7? Don't you know PHP 5.6 is deprecated

A very good question imaginary person. This repo is being created for something
that is still running PHP 5.6 and therefore I am limiting everything here to PHP 5.6
for the time being.

Once said project has been upgraded to 7.x I will be releasing version 2 of this
repository with all the shiny new PHP 7 features.

Until then it's staying PHP 5.6 compatible, Sorry!
